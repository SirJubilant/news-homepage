### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://news-homepage-invy8jk3a-sirjubilant.vercel.app/)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt that for designs with complex grid layout, it is better to adopt a desktop first approach to developing it, this would give less headache when designing the mobile layout.

I implemented the use of keyframes for animations for the firs time in any project. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

For future projects, I hope to pick up on more complicated projects where i'd have to utilize Javascript frameworks/libraries for projects with lot of dynamic inputs.
